# Sorry, I lost my bash history again. I will commit the commands that I remember I used.
# This happens because I have linked my vs code bash to the git account to avoid having to
# enter my password every time I want to do pull or push... and it seems it gets erased
# after closing the project/vs code. I switched a couple times between projects as usually.
# Sorry again.

git clone {URL}
git pull
git add .
git commit -m "{message}"
git push

I have created the branch using git GUI, but here is the command that I use if need to do it by hand:

git checkout -b {branch-name}

Also, about gulp:

npm install (to get current node modules listed on package.json)
gulp (to run gulp)
npm i --save-dev gulp-concat (install gulp-concat)
